    '''
       Calc density of water depending on T [°C] and P [Pa]
       defined between 0 and 40 °C and given in g/m3
       Thiesen Equation after CIPM
       Tanaka et al. 2001, http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/38/4/3

       NOTE: the effect of solved salts, isotopic composition, etc. remain
       disregarded here. especially the former will need to be closely
       considerd in a revised version! DEBUG.
       
       INPUT:  Temperature T in °C as numpy.array
               Pressure P in Pa as numpy.array (-9999 for not considered)
       OUTPUT: Water Density in g/m3
       
       EXAMPLE: waterdensity(np.array((20,21,42)),np.array(-9999.))
